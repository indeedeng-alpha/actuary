# Actuary

Actuary is a generalized solution for attributing cost across software platforms.
It implements the server side component as described in Mya's [paper on cost attribution](cost-attribution.pdf).
You can find the most recent copy of her paper [here](https://github.com/mjpitz/mjpitz/blob/main/papers/cost-attribution.pdf).
